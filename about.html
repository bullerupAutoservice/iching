                    The culture hero Fu Xi, a dragon or a snake with a human face, studied the patterns of nature in the sky and on the earth: 
					the markings on birds, rocks, and animals, the movement of clouds, the arrangement of the stars. 
					<br><br>
					What you are reading and experiencing is a modern interpretation of the ancient wisdom that is found in the I Ching book of changes. 
					It is a contemporary exchange between the old guidings of the 64 hexagrams and artificial generated text. <br> <br>
					As the foundation for this project the GPT-2 transformer based language model has been used to synthesize text samples as a response or rather as a form of continuing dialouge between old and new. 
					GPT-2 is a machine learning algorithm that works in a sort of chameleon-like manner - it tries to adapt to the style and content of a given dataset, in this case the work Fear and Loathing in Las vegas. 
					<br><br>
					The importance of this project lies not so much in what advice you might be given, but rather that you are prompted to reflect upon what questions you want answered. 
					Because it is in the questions we ask that we find a way to clarity. <br>

					I have always had a fascination about the I Ching, and during the outbreak of COVID-19 it became very clear to me that there 
					might be a way of fighting the virus psychological effects by using an ancient chinese system to offer a guiding light in these strange times.
					<br>
					There is a number of reasons why I have chosen Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, and I want to list these two as most important: 
					I have chosen Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is due to its very unique style of writing. I wanted to see how well the GPT-2 model would be able to adapt and respond to, in a way, 
					an almost opposite textual style.  
					<br>

					We are drawn into a world in Fear and Loathing where society is rotten and infected by what might be the ultimate consequence of capitalism - which is to a greater extent a far more dangerous virus.  

					At last, I want to thank this <a href="https://www.ichingappofchanges.com/app/index.html?FaceBookClick"> open source license for yarrow-sort I Ching</a> - the underlying principle of the determination of the cast hexagram.
